# SigTest documentation plan

## Overview aka What is it and what's it for


This library can compare TypeScript npm package exported file members for backwards compatibility.
Also it can generate reports (changelogs) and generate migration scripts (not all cases)
when code changes braked backwards compatibility.

You can need it when you:
 - care about npm module backwards compatibility.
 - want to test your library and know what version to bump patch or minor.
 - want to have generated changelog in each version change.

What it can do: overview of features (comparison, configuration, reports)

Why you need it

What problems it solves aka You didn't know you needed it but now you do

What it **doesn't** do: when SigTest won't help you
